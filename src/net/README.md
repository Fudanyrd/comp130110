# Add Networking Support

I have completed the 6th lab of xv6-riscv. I hope to
also add network support for my FDUOS.

If time should allow, I may consider adding a TCP/IP protocol
stack.

# Currently Support

<ul>
    <li> An UDP/IP stack; </li>
    <li> Packet transmission; </li>
</ul>

# Tests

## net_test.c

Usage: start the `server.py` and then `make net-test` in the build directory.

# Bugs

None found so far.
